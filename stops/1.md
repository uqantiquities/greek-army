## <i>Χαιρε!</i> Welcome! 
In this audio tour, we will explore the art and archaeology of Greek Warfare! 

War and hostility was considered a normal part of the relationships between Greek city-states and was a frequent occurrence throughout the 5th and 4th centuries BC and into the Hellenistic period. Military service was required of citizens and military prowess was an important measure of a man’s worth. 

A soldier’s role in the army was often determined by his social and economic position. 

The phalanx required hoplites, one of the best known types of Greek soldier, to fight as a unit, protecting each other their shields. If a hoplite left his place in the ranks, either to flee or push forward to fight alone, he placed the rest of the phalanx at risk. The phalanx had a long and important history for the Greeks, reaching back into Homeric epic. 

This tour will explore the training and equipment of the Greek hoplite, how it was used, and why it was effective.
