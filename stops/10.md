This stop concludes your tour. 

In this audio tour, we have learnt about the art of Greek warfare, the equipment of the hoplite, and how soldiers were trained. The artefacts featured in this tour demonstrate how widespread warfare and its associated imagery were in Greek culture. 

Thank you for joining us at the R.D. Milns Antiquities Museum.

Please wait at this final stop for further instructions from your tour guide about how to return your iPads and headphones.
